## How to run the code 
## Assignment 1

 From the Lab1 directory
 From a regular shell

	  python main.py 

 Note that it may require additional libraries.
 Main.py generates three .csv files containing the algorithms output.

 After generating the .csv files, run:

      python plot.py

 in order to gererate the final graphs.

## Assignment 2 

 From the Lab2 directory
 From a regular shell

	  python main.py 

 Note that it may require additional libraries.
 Main.py generates five .csv files containing the algorithms output and their relative graphs.

 ## Assignment 3
 From the Lab3 directory
