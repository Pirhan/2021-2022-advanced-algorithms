# Advanced algorithms assignment
Advanced algorithms class assignment for A.A. year 2021/2022

## Assignment 1 - Minimum spanning tree
**Deadline: Monday 25 April, 11:55 pm**
## How to run cythonized code

 From the Lab1 directory
 From a regular shell

	  pypy main.py 

 Note that it may require additional libraries.
 Main.py generates three .csv files containing the algorithms output.

 After generating the .csv files, run:

      python plot.py

 in order to gererate the final graphs.
 Not on pypy because matplotlib is not fully supported.
